# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) contains 815 (and counting!) mathematical challenges that require programming tools to be solved. I will slowly be working through these problems -- putting my solutions in this repository. 

Solutions will most likely and/or predominantly be written in C++.

Guided by Stephan Brumme's [page](https://euler.stephan-brumme.com).
